# RuinArena

An independent, community-driven game project which focuses on bringing the multiplayer fast-paced third person melee combat from Rune (2001) to Unreal Engine 4.

This project's main development repository is hosted on GitLab. All content, source files, and UASSET files have been stripped out here. This repository is meant for sharing the project's current state.
