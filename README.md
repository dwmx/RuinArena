# RuinArena

An independent, community-driven game project which focuses on bringing the multiplayer fast-paced third person melee combat from Rune (2001) to Unreal Engine 4.

This project's main development repository is hosted on GitLab. All content, source files, and UASSET files have been stripped out here. This repository is meant only for sharing information about the project's current state.

## Constable - By Shawn Davison
After winning the RuneGame.com 2008 community mapping contest, Constable went on to become one of the most played DeathMatch maps among the online Rune community. With the original map's incredible blending of visual detail and fast-paced combat, Constable is the perfect map for a modern third person arena game.
